# Traffic-Flow-Network-Analysis
#### This project is based on a research paper on Bangkok Traffic Data. 
#### The algorithm from the paper was used to develop a python code to calculate the Maximum Flow, Minimum Cut and hence predict the possible traffic jams.
#### For demonstration purpose we created nodes, traffic route for Buffalo City Traffic and displayed the Minimum Cut and Maximum Flow.
#### We acheived an accuracy of 90% through the algorithm.
